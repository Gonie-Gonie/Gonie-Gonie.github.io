# Link icons

Software-link and contact icons are stored together in this directory. Technology
icons remain in the neighboring `technologies` directory.

## Existing SVG artwork

These files were extracted from the existing inline SVG artwork in
`app/assets/js/app.js`; they are not newly downloaded or newly designed logos:

- `github.svg`: the existing software-link GitHub mark, shared by software links
  and the profile contact link.
- `repository.svg`, `package.svg`, `container.svg`, `archive.svg`, `webpage.svg`:
  generic software-link icons, not site-specific brand logos.
- `email.svg`, `address.svg`: contact glyphs.
- `orcid.svg`, `scholar.svg`, `linkedin.svg`: existing contact artwork with its
  original colors.

Monochrome SVGs are rendered as CSS masks so their color continues to follow the
surrounding link. Color artwork is rendered with an `img` element to retain its
colors. Generic software-link SVGs include their original rounded stroke styling
so they also work as standalone files.

The existing artwork's provenance and rights are unchanged by this extraction.
Brand marks identify their respective services; extracting them does not grant
additional rights to those marks.
